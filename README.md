# Custom Enumerable Project

This repository contains my solutions to The Odin Project's [Custom Enumerables Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-custom-enumerables).

This repository complements the [Custom Enumerables Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-custom-enumerables) in the Ruby Course for The Odin Project. The goal of this project is to reimplement common methods used frequently through the enumerables module with objects like arrays and hashes. 

# Methods

The following table has the methods that were implemented along with their associated specs, as outlined in the project instructions.

| Method                          | Spec File                       | Notes                                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Array#my_each`                 | spec/my_each_spec.rb            | You will define my_each on the Array class in `lib/my_enumerables.rb` |
| `Enumerable#my_each_with_index` | spec/my_each_with_index_spec.rb |                                                                       |

| `Enumerable#my_none?`           | spec/my_none_spec.rb            |                                                                       |
| `Enumerable#my_count`           | spec/my_count_spec.rb           |                                                                       |
| `Enumerable#my_map`             | spec/my_map_spec.rb             |                                                                       |
